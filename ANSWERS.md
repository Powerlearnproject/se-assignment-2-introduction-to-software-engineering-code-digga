# Software Engineering Week 1 Assignment.

### 1. What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software Engineering is the application of Engineering principles to the development of software solutions. It involves collaboration between cross-functional teams and analysis of users needs. Traditional programming on the other hand, is writing computer programs to instruct the computer. A programmer is mostly involved in coding, debugging and maintaining software applications while the engineer will also be involved in collaborating with stakeholders, getting requirements and writing specifications.

### 2. Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

The phases of Software Development Life Cycle are as follows:

- **Plan:** in this phase requirements for the project is gathered and the software requirement specification is done. The detailed expectations and common goals are set up.
- **Design**: in this phase, software engineers consider all requirements and decide the best way to implement a solution. They consider tools to be used and make necessary technical decisions such as database requirements, system design etc.
- **Implement**: in this phase, engineers or developers begin to build the solution through coding or other means available.
- **Test**: team carries out testing on product. This can be either automated or manual. This phase will mostly run in parallel with the development phase.
- **Deploy**: after the softwar e has been developed, fully tested and approved, it will be deployed for consumers to begin making use of the product.
- **Maintenance**: after a software has been deployed, the team will employ tools to monitor the service and recieve users feedback in order to keep improving the system.

### 3. Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
